# Login Form With Firebase Authentication
#### This repository contains a simple login form built using Svelte and Firebase Authentication. The form includes fields for email and password, and allows users to sign in or create a new account.
### Getting Started
#### To get started with this repository, you'll need to have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js
- npm
#### Once you have these installed, you can clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/y/AshwiniSh1nde/LoginFormWithFirebase.git```
#### Next, navigate to the repository directory and install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```npm install```
#### Now that you have the required dependencies installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:
```npm run dev```
#### This will start the development server and open your default browser to `http://localhost:5000` . You should now see the login form in your browser.
### Configuring Firebase Authentication
#### Before you can use Firebase Authentication, you'll need to create a Firebase project and configure the authentication settings. To do this, follow these steps:

- Go to the Firebase Console.
- Create a new project by clicking the Create Project button.
- Once your project is created, click on the Authentication section in the side menu.
- Click the Sign-In Method tab and enable email/password authentication.
- Copy the Firebase Configuration from the Firebase Console and  paste it into the `+page.svelte` file in the src/route directory.
### Using the Login Form
#### Once you have the development server running and Firebase Authentication configured, you can start using the login form.

#### To sign in with an existing account, enter the email and password associated with the account and click the Sign In button.
